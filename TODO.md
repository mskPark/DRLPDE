TODO Upgrades:
    Figure out how to make this work for non-convex regions
    Different boundary types
        curves (x, f(x)), (g(y), y)
        cubic splines given a sequence of points
    3D space boundary types
        spheres, cylinders
        surfaces (x, y, f(x,y)), (x, g(x,z), z), (h(y,z), y, z)
    

TODO Consider Adding/Changing:
    Girsanov Theorem
    Finding an actual point on the boundary instead of closest up to a tolerance
    How to evaluate integral in reaction and forcing terms (right now using right-end evaluation)
