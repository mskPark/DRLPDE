- Split domain into 
  + For N boundaries, N+1 regions (close to i-th boundary)
  + Quick method of checking if walker is in which boundary
  + Tree structure for optimal region checking

- Number of boundary points
  + Utilize the length/area of the boundary to divide up the total number of points evenly
  + 

- Different boundary types
  + curves (x, f(x)), (g(y), y)
  + cubic splines given a sequence of points (Bezier curves)
  
- 3D space boundary types
  + spheres, cylinders
  + surfaces (x, y, f(x,y)), (x, g(x,z), z), (h(y,z), y, z)
